    "Bagging reduces overfitting in decision trees by training multiple trees on different subsets of the data, each constructed using a random sample with replacement (bootstrap sample). Since each tree sees only a subset of the data, it tends to capture different patterns or noise in the data. When aggregating the predictions of these trees, the overfitting tendencies of individual trees are mitigated, leading to a more robust and generalized model."

Base learners with low bias and high variance (e.g., deep decision trees) tend to benefit more from bagging as it reduces variance. On the other hand, base learners with high bias (e.g., shallow decision trees) may not see significant improvements from bagging but can still benefit from reduced variance."

By aggregating the predictions of diverse models, the ensemble model can provide more reliable risk assessments, reducing the likelihood of approving risky loans and minimizing financial losses for lenders.\n",
